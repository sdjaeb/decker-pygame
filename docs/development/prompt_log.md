# Prompt Log: Hardening the Architecture

This document tracks the prompts and outcomes during the major refactoring to a Domain-Driven Design architecture.

1.  **Prompt:** "I'd like to create a new docs file describing how the DDD concepts are implemented."
    -   **Outcome:** Created the initial `ddd_implementation_guidelines.md` document with a comprehensive overview of DDD concepts in Python.

2.  **Prompt:** "The new ddd document is too long. Let's build it in parts... I would also like this to have the concept of an event-driven baseline...even just dumping to a raw json file or something is sufficient."
    -   **Outcome:** Created a more concise v1 of the guidelines, introduced domain events, and implemented a `JsonFileOrderRepository` for simple persistence.

3.  **Prompt:** "where do these new files live?"
    -   **Outcome:** Provided the target directory structure for the layered architecture and placed the new files (`events.py`, `repositories.py`) in their correct locations.

4.  **Prompt:** "Refresh the directory heirarchy based on the current project structure. Apply the new DDD elements to the existing components in the codebase."
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the entire project structure into `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, and `presentation` layers. Adapted DDD examples to be specific to the `decker-pygame` context (e.g., `Player` aggregate).

5.  **Prompt:** "where does events.py and services.py live? What directories/folders am I missing?"
    -   **Outcome:** Confirmed the correct locations for `events.py` and `services.py`, identified missing `__init__.py` files and layer directories, and corrected imports in `main.py`.

6.  **Prompt:** "can you build me a quick script to set up the directories?"
    -   **Outcome:** Provided a `setup_directories.sh` script to scaffold the new layered architecture.

7.  **Prompt:** "Audit the codebase. I missed some files, specifically getting main.py working: PlayerService and JsonFilePlayerRepository"
    -   **Outcome:** Created the missing `PlayerService` and `JsonFilePlayerRepository` files and placed them in the correct `application` and `infrastructure` layers.

8.  **Prompt:** "events.py seems to have extra content in it. Break it up. Also review the persistence.py file."
    -   **Outcome:** Separated domain concepts into `events.py`, `model.py`, and `repositories.py`. Reviewed and added comments to `persistence.py`.

9.  **Prompt:** "I never made the persistence.py, please display the full content + path"
    -   **Outcome:** Provided the full, correct implementation for `infrastructure/persistence.py`.

10. **Prompt:** "We also have the other .py files: asset_loader.py game.py config.py settings.py utils.py - should they move too?"
    -   **Outcome:** Analyzed the files and recommended moving `game.py` and `asset_loader.py` into the `presentation` layer.

11. **Prompt:** "now we fix tests: E ModuleNotFoundError..."
    -   **Outcome:** Identified that tests needed their imports updated to match the new file locations and provided guidance on how to fix them.

12. **Prompt:** "The directories that organize_presentation_layer.sh in scripts touch are incorrect..."
    -   **Outcome:** Corrected the shell script to be runnable from any directory by making its paths relative to the script's own location.

13. **Prompt:** "I have not PlayerService it looks like"
    -   **Outcome:** Created the missing `application/services.py` file containing the `PlayerService` class.

14. **Prompt:** "services.py: Argument of type "UUID" cannot be assigned to parameter "player_id" of type "PlayerId"..."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed the type error by explicitly casting the `uuid.UUID` to the `PlayerId` `NewType`.

15. **Prompt:** "E TypeError: non-default argument 'player_id' follows default argument 'timestamp'..."
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the base `Event` from a `dataclass` to a `Protocol` to resolve the argument order issue.

16. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/test_main.py... FAILED tests/test_main_dunder_guard.py..."
    -   **Outcome:** Corrected the main tests to reflect that `main.py` is now a Composition Root and no longer directly instantiates the `Game` class.

17. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/test_main_dunder_guard.py... AssertionError: Expected 'main' to have been called once. Called 0 times." (and subsequent failures)
    -   **Outcome:** Diagnosed and fixed subtle issues with `runpy` and `unittest.mock.patch`, ensuring the dunder guard test correctly patched dependencies at their source.

18. **Prompt:** "Missing test coverage..."
    -   **Outcome:** Added new test files and methods to cover the remaining logic in the domain model and infrastructure layers.

19. **Prompt:** "Update documentation. audit codebase and see if there is any other architecture hardening we could do..."
    -   **Outcome:** Reorganized test files to mirror the source structure, connected the Presentation Layer to the Application Layer via Dependency Injection in `main.py`, and updated the DDD guide.

20. **Prompt:** "test_main and test_main_dunder_guard actually runs the game... This is undesirable..."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed the main tests to correctly mock the `Game` class, preventing the Pygame window from launching during test execution.

21. **Prompt:** "Game doesn't have player_service and player_id"
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the `Game` class `__init__` method to accept the injected `PlayerService` and `player_id`.

22. **Prompt:** "update tests, update documentation"
    -   **Outcome:** Updated `test_game.py` to correctly mock and inject the `PlayerService`. Removed obsolete tests. Updated the DDD guide to emphasize a stateless Presentation Layer.

23. **Prompt:** "Can we add a document detailing information about Domain-Driven Design, with an overview of the concepts we're using...?"
    -   **Outcome:** Created the `docs/architecture/ddd_concepts.md` file, mapping abstract DDD concepts to concrete files and classes in the project.

24. **Prompt:** "what can I do with the domain events? Can we change the PlayerCreated and CharacterCreated events to use the Event base class (protocol)?"
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored domain events to inherit from a common `BaseEvent` dataclass, reducing code duplication and clarifying the design.

25. **Prompt:** "I think we should spend a little time enhancing the event system before we move on. Questions: 1. How are the events emitted?..."
    -   **Outcome:** Implemented a full, simple event system, including an `EventDispatcher`, a logging `EventHandler`, and wired them into the `PlayerService` and `main.py` Composition Root.

26. **Prompt:** "I would like to add an annotation to functions that emit events, and another annotation to functions that handle events."
    -   **Outcome:** Created the `@emits` and `@handles` decorators in `application/decorators.py` to improve the semantic clarity of the event-driven architecture.

27. **Prompt:** "We should probably add a feature of the event system that allows for handlers to only fire if a condition has occured."
    -   **Outcome:** Enhanced the `EventDispatcher` to accept an optional `condition` function during subscription, allowing for more flexible and targeted event handling.

28. **Prompt:** "Will the conditional event wait and then fire when the condition occurs?..."
    -   **Outcome:** Clarified the distinction between immediate, stateless conditional event handling and stateful command validation. Explained that business rule preconditions should be checked in the Application Service *before* an event is created. Introduced the Saga pattern as a future solution for complex, long-running processes.

29. **Prompt:** "would it be easier to allow a list of events to handlers, like emits?" (and subsequent fixes for `ruff` and `mypy`)
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the `@handles` decorator to accept multiple event types, improving its ergonomics. Resolved several advanced typing and linting issues to make the decorator implementation robust and compliant with all code quality tools.

30. **Prompt:** "Before we can embark on our first event storming session, let's finish porting the remainder of the original codebase..."
    -   **Outcome:** Established a plan to port the remaining UI "Dialogs" as "Views". Created a flexible domain model for a crafting system, including `Schematic` and `RequiredResource` Value Objects and an `ItemCrafted` event.

31. **Prompt:** "Let's create the `CharacterRepositoryInterface` and `JsonFileCharacterRepository` now."
    -   **Outcome:** Implemented the persistence layer for the `Character` aggregate, including the domain interface and the JSON file-based infrastructure implementation, along with full test coverage.

32. **Prompt:** "Let's create the `CraftingService` and its tests now."
    -   **Outcome:** Created the `CraftingService` to orchestrate the "craft item" use case. Defined custom exceptions for clear error handling and added a full suite of tests to validate its behavior.

33. **Prompt:** "Let's update the main composition root to include the new `CraftingService` and `CharacterRepository`."
    -   **Outcome:** Wired up the new `CraftingService` and `JsonFileCharacterRepository` in `main.py`. Updated the `Game` class instantiation to include the new dependencies, and updated tests to match.

34. **Prompt:** "Refactor the `Game` class to accept and use the new `CraftingService` and `character_id`."
    -   **Outcome:** Updated the `Game` class `__init__` method to accept and store the `CraftingService` and `character_id`. Refactored the corresponding tests in `test_game.py` to provide the new dependencies.

35. **Prompt:** "Let's create the `BuildView` UI component and its tests now."
    -   **Outcome:** Created the `BuildView` component, a "dumb" sprite that displays a list of schematics and uses a callback to handle user input. Added a full suite of tests to verify its rendering and event handling logic.

36. **Prompt:** "Now, let's integrate the `BuildView` into the `Game` class."
    -   **Outcome:** Integrated the `BuildView` into the main `Game` class. Added a query method to the `CraftingService` to fetch data for the view, and implemented event handlers in the `Game` class to toggle the view's visibility and connect its actions to the service.

37. **Prompt:** "Now that crafting is working, let's add an event handler that displays a message in a `MessageView` when an item is crafted."
    -   **Outcome:** Added a `MessageView` to the `Game` class and a `show_message` method to control it. In the composition root (`main.py`), subscribed a lambda function to the `ItemCrafted` event, which calls the `show_message` method, demonstrating a clean UI reaction to a domain event.

38. **Prompt:** "Cannot access attribute "assert_called_once_with" for class "MethodType"..."
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a `Pylance` type-checking error in `test_crafting_service.py` by changing mock creation from `spec=Character` to the more robust `autospec=Character`.

39. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_toggles_build_view..."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed two test failures by improving mock configurations. Used `spec=BuildView` to create a more realistic sprite mock and corrected the order of mock setup in `test_main.py` to ensure dependencies were configured before the code under test was called.

40. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_toggles_build_view - assert 3 == 2"
    -   **Outcome:** Corrected an assertion in `test_game.py` that was not updated after a new default sprite was added to the `Game` class. Also improved mock quality by switching from `spec` to `autospec` for service mocks.

41. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_initialization - AssertionError: assert False"
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed a test fixture that was providing an invalid empty list to a UI component, causing an initialization error. The mock for `load_spritesheet` was updated to return a valid mock icon.

42. **Prompt:** "ERROR tests/presentation/test_game.py... TypeError: argument 1 must be pygame.surface.Surface, not Mock"
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a `TypeError` in the `test_game.py` suite by updating a mock in a shared fixture. The mock for `load_spritesheet` was changed to return a real `pygame.Surface` instead of a `Mock` object, satisfying the type requirements of un-mocked Pygame functions.

43. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_initialization - AssertionError: assert False"
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a cryptic test failure by refactoring the `Game` class to remove a redundant `pygame.init()` call. This improved the design by clarifying responsibilities and stabilized the test fixture environment.

44. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_initialization - AssertionError: assert False (re-run)"
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a recurring cryptic test failure by patching `pygame.transform.scale` in the shared `mocked_game_instance` fixture. This prevents a hidden exception during `Game` initialization in the test environment.

45. **Prompt:** "still having the same issue: ... AssertionError: assert False"
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved the final cryptic `assert False` error by refactoring the `test_game.py` fixture to be more explicit. The test now verifies dependency injection using an identity check (`is`) instead of a problematic type check (`isinstance`) on a mock object.

46. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_initialization - AssertionError: assert False"
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed a failing test by removing a redundant and incorrect `isinstance` check on a mock object. Also corrected a typo in another test that was incorrectly accessing a method on a mock service.

47. **Prompt:** "Refactor `AlarmBar` and `HealthBar` to inherit from a common `PercentageBar` base class to reduce code duplication."
    -   **Outcome:** Created a new `PercentageBar` base class to contain shared drawing logic. Refactored `AlarmBar` and `HealthBar` to inherit from it, simplifying their code. Updated and added tests to ensure full coverage of the new structure.

48. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py... TypeError: AlarmBar.__init__() takes 4 positional arguments but 5 were given"
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed a `TypeError` by updating the `AlarmBar` instantiation in the `Game` class to match the component's refactored constructor signature.

49. **Prompt:** "Now that the `PercentageBar` is done, let's update the `Game` class to use the `HealthBar`."
    -   **Outcome:** Added a `get_player_status` query method to the `PlayerService`. Integrated the `HealthBar` component into the `Game` class, which now calls the service to update the bar's state each frame. Added and updated tests to ensure coverage.

50. **Prompt:** "test_game.py has some missing coverage and test failures."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed `TypeError` in `test_game.py` by configuring mock services to return valid DTOs. Added new tests to cover edge cases (e.g., no schematics available, player not found) and improved existing tests to check console output, resolving all coverage gaps.

51. **Prompt:** "let's try a real local run... ModuleNotFoundError... Can we make it config-driven so we don't have to worry about test coverage...?"
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed the `ModuleNotFoundError` by correcting the project's entry point script in `pyproject.toml`. Implemented a config-driven "dev mode" using an environment variable to allow for rapid prototyping without impacting tests.

52. **Prompt:** "decker... pygame.error: font not initialized"
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed a runtime error by adding `pygame.init()` to the application's main entry point (`main.py`), ensuring the framework is initialized before any UI components are created.

53. **Prompt:** "everything is running now. How can I test my Views and UI elements? Let's start with something simple first."
    -   **Outcome:** Provided a step-by-step guide for manually testing the `BuildView`. Refactored the `Game` class to use the `MessageView` for user feedback instead of printing to the console, and updated tests accordingly.

54. **Prompt:** "I see b bring up the build dialog (open and close). But the font is hard to read against the grey background."
    -   **Outcome:** Improved UI readability by adding a new `dark_font_color` to the settings. Updated `BuildView` and `MessageView` to use this new color, providing better contrast on light backgrounds without affecting text on dark backgrounds.

55. **Prompt:** "I clicked it a few times... ValueError: Insufficient credits... We shouldn't crash... I'm not seeing the ItemCrafted event in stdout."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed the crash by having the `CraftingService` catch the domain's `ValueError` and re-raise it as a specific `InsufficientResourcesError`. Added a new event handler to log `ItemCrafted` events to the console.

56. **Prompt:** "the separate log functions for each event will quickly become a maintenance nightmare. Can we consolidate...?"
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the logging system using a Strategy pattern. Created a `LoggingService` and `LogWriter` protocol. Replaced specific event loggers with a generic, reusable event handler factory, making the system more scalable and maintainable.

57. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/application/test_crafting_service.py... FAILED tests/application/test_event_handlers.py..."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed two test failures. Updated a test to expect the correct application-level exception (`InsufficientResourcesError`). Corrected another test to properly inspect the positional and keyword arguments passed to a mocked method.

58. **Prompt:** "We're missing some test coverage: game.py... logging_service.py..."
    -   **Outcome:** Added new tests to cover edge cases and untested public methods, including the scenario where no icons are loaded and the `LoggingService.register` method, bringing test coverage back to 100%.

59. **Prompt:** "Add q to quit the game... should keypresses be logged?"
    -   **Outcome:** Added 'q' as a quit key. Implemented a dev-mode-only input logger by injecting the `LoggingService` into the `Game` class, keeping domain and input logging separate. Updated all relevant tests.

59. **Prompt:** "coverage is still missing for line 10 (logging_service) and 83-92 (game)"
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved final coverage gaps by adding a `# pragma: no cover` to a protocol definition and adding new, focused tests for an edge case in `_load_assets` and a public method in `LoggingService`.

60. **Prompt:** "game is still lacking coverage for line 83-92"
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed a critical issue in the test suite where a test function was duplicated, which likely caused inaccurate coverage reports. Also added a `pragma: no cover` to a protocol definition to resolve the final remaining coverage gap.

61. **Prompt:** "Game is still having an issue. Perhaps refactoring to move the scaling logic to a function might make it easier, and reusable for other components."
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the icon scaling logic from the `Game` class into a new, reusable `scale_icons` utility function. Added dedicated tests for the new utility, resolving the final test coverage gap in `game.py`.

62. **Prompt:** "E           AssertionError: expected call not found."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed a failing test by correctly configuring a mock's return value. The mock for the `scale_icons` utility was updated to return an empty list, matching the expected behavior of the real function.

63. **Prompt:** "E           AssertionError: assert 0 == 1"
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed a failing test by configuring a mock for the `scale_icons` utility to return a list with one item, ensuring the test environment accurately reflected the expected data flow.

64. **Prompt:** "mypy... error: Only concrete class can be given where 'type[Event]' is expected"
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a `mypy` error by adding a `# type: ignore[type-abstract]` comment to a decorator. This acknowledges the intentional use of an abstract `Protocol` type for semantic purposes, which the type checker correctly flags as an issue.

65. **Prompt:** "decker runs, so let's get documentation updated with the new efficiencies and improvements we've made. I would also like help crafting a cz commit message"
    -   **Outcome:** Crafted a comprehensive commit message summarizing recent features and fixes. Updated the `ddd_implementation_guide.md` to include a new section on handling development-specific features in a clean, config-driven way.

66. **Prompt:** "missing test coverage, presumably from the refactorings we've done..."
    -   **Outcome:** Added new tests to cover the "dev mode" logic in `main.py` and all branches of the `get_and_ensure_rect` utility function, bringing test coverage back to 100%.

67. **Prompt:** ""size" is not a known attribute of "None""
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a `Pylance` static analysis error in `test_utils.py` by using a function's correctly-typed return value in an assertion, rather than relying on a dynamically-added attribute that the type checker could not infer.

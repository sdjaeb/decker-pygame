# Prompt Log: Hardening the Architecture

This document tracks the prompts and outcomes during the major refactoring to a Domain-Driven Design architecture.

1.  **Prompt:** "I'd like to create a new docs file describing how the DDD concepts are implemented."
    -   **Outcome:** Created the initial `ddd_implementation_guidelines.md` document with a comprehensive overview of DDD concepts in Python.

2.  **Prompt:** "The new ddd document is too long. Let's build it in parts... I would also like this to have the concept of an event-driven baseline...even just dumping to a raw json file or something is sufficient."
    -   **Outcome:** Created a more concise v1 of the guidelines, introduced domain events, and implemented a `JsonFileOrderRepository` for simple persistence.

3.  **Prompt:** "where do these new files live?"
    -   **Outcome:** Provided the target directory structure for the layered architecture and placed the new files (`events.py`, `repositories.py`) in their correct locations.

4.  **Prompt:** "Refresh the directory heirarchy based on the current project structure. Apply the new DDD elements to the existing components in the codebase."
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the entire project structure into `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, and `presentation` layers. Adapted DDD examples to be specific to the `decker-pygame` context (e.g., `Player` aggregate).

5.  **Prompt:** "where does events.py and services.py live? What directories/folders am I missing?"
    -   **Outcome:** Confirmed the correct locations for `events.py` and `services.py`, identified missing `__init__.py` files and layer directories, and corrected imports in `main.py`.

6.  **Prompt:** "can you build me a quick script to set up the directories?"
    -   **Outcome:** Provided a `setup_directories.sh` script to scaffold the new layered architecture.

7.  **Prompt:** "Audit the codebase. I missed some files, specifically getting main.py working: PlayerService and JsonFilePlayerRepository"
    -   **Outcome:** Created the missing `PlayerService` and `JsonFilePlayerRepository` files and placed them in the correct `application` and `infrastructure` layers.

8.  **Prompt:** "events.py seems to have extra content in it. Break it up. Also review the persistence.py file."
    -   **Outcome:** Separated domain concepts into `events.py`, `model.py`, and `repositories.py`. Reviewed and added comments to `persistence.py`.

9.  **Prompt:** "I never made the persistence.py, please display the full content + path"
    -   **Outcome:** Provided the full, correct implementation for `infrastructure/persistence.py`.

10. **Prompt:** "We also have the other .py files: asset_loader.py game.py config.py settings.py utils.py - should they move too?"
    -   **Outcome:** Analyzed the files and recommended moving `game.py` and `asset_loader.py` into the `presentation` layer.

11. **Prompt:** "now we fix tests: E ModuleNotFoundError..."
    -   **Outcome:** Identified that tests needed their imports updated to match the new file locations and provided guidance on how to fix them.

12. **Prompt:** "The directories that organize_presentation_layer.sh in scripts touch are incorrect..."
    -   **Outcome:** Corrected the shell script to be runnable from any directory by making its paths relative to the script's own location.

13. **Prompt:** "I have not PlayerService it looks like"
    -   **Outcome:** Created the missing `application/services.py` file containing the `PlayerService` class.

14. **Prompt:** "services.py: Argument of type "UUID" cannot be assigned to parameter "player_id" of type "PlayerId"..."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed the type error by explicitly casting the `uuid.UUID` to the `PlayerId` `NewType`.

15. **Prompt:** "E TypeError: non-default argument 'player_id' follows default argument 'timestamp'..."
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the base `Event` from a `dataclass` to a `Protocol` to resolve the argument order issue.

16. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/test_main.py... FAILED tests/test_main_dunder_guard.py..."
    -   **Outcome:** Corrected the main tests to reflect that `main.py` is now a Composition Root and no longer directly instantiates the `Game` class.

17. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/test_main_dunder_guard.py... AssertionError: Expected 'main' to have been called once. Called 0 times." (and subsequent failures)
    -   **Outcome:** Diagnosed and fixed subtle issues with `runpy` and `unittest.mock.patch`, ensuring the dunder guard test correctly patched dependencies at their source.

18. **Prompt:** "Missing test coverage..."
    -   **Outcome:** Added new test files and methods to cover the remaining logic in the domain model and infrastructure layers.

19. **Prompt:** "Update documentation. audit codebase and see if there is any other architecture hardening we could do..."
    -   **Outcome:** Reorganized test files to mirror the source structure, connected the Presentation Layer to the Application Layer via Dependency Injection in `main.py`, and updated the DDD guide.

20. **Prompt:** "test_main and test_main_dunder_guard actually runs the game... This is undesirable..."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed the main tests to correctly mock the `Game` class, preventing the Pygame window from launching during test execution.

21. **Prompt:** "Game doesn't have player_service and player_id"
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the `Game` class `__init__` method to accept the injected `PlayerService` and `player_id`.

22. **Prompt:** "update tests, update documentation"
    -   **Outcome:** Updated `test_game.py` to correctly mock and inject the `PlayerService`. Removed obsolete tests. Updated the DDD guide to emphasize a stateless Presentation Layer.

23. **Prompt:** "Can we add a document detailing information about Domain-Driven Design, with an overview of the concepts we're using...?"
    -   **Outcome:** Created the `docs/architecture/ddd_concepts.md` file, mapping abstract DDD concepts to concrete files and classes in the project.

24. **Prompt:** "what can I do with the domain events? Can we change the PlayerCreated and CharacterCreated events to use the Event base class (protocol)?"
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored domain events to inherit from a common `BaseEvent` dataclass, reducing code duplication and clarifying the design.

25. **Prompt:** "I think we should spend a little time enhancing the event system before we move on. Questions: 1. How are the events emitted?..."
    -   **Outcome:** Implemented a full, simple event system, including an `EventDispatcher`, a logging `EventHandler`, and wired them into the `PlayerService` and `main.py` Composition Root.

26. **Prompt:** "I would like to add an annotation to functions that emit events, and another annotation to functions that handle events."
    -   **Outcome:** Created the `@emits` and `@handles` decorators in `application/decorators.py` to improve the semantic clarity of the event-driven architecture.

27. **Prompt:** "We should probably add a feature of the event system that allows for handlers to only fire if a condition has occured."
    -   **Outcome:** Enhanced the `EventDispatcher` to accept an optional `condition` function during subscription, allowing for more flexible and targeted event handling.

28. **Prompt:** "Will the conditional event wait and then fire when the condition occurs?..."
    -   **Outcome:** Clarified the distinction between immediate, stateless conditional event handling and stateful command validation. Explained that business rule preconditions should be checked in the Application Service *before* an event is created. Introduced the Saga pattern as a future solution for complex, long-running processes.

29. **Prompt:** "would it be easier to allow a list of events to handlers, like emits?" (and subsequent fixes for `ruff` and `mypy`)
    -   **Outcome:** Refactored the `@handles` decorator to accept multiple event types, improving its ergonomics. Resolved several advanced typing and linting issues to make the decorator implementation robust and compliant with all code quality tools.

30. **Prompt:** "Before we can embark on our first event storming session, let's finish porting the remainder of the original codebase..."
    -   **Outcome:** Established a plan to port the remaining UI "Dialogs" as "Views". Created a flexible domain model for a crafting system, including `Schematic` and `RequiredResource` Value Objects and an `ItemCrafted` event.

31. **Prompt:** "Let's create the `CharacterRepositoryInterface` and `JsonFileCharacterRepository` now."
    -   **Outcome:** Implemented the persistence layer for the `Character` aggregate, including the domain interface and the JSON file-based infrastructure implementation, along with full test coverage.

32. **Prompt:** "Let's create the `CraftingService` and its tests now."
    -   **Outcome:** Created the `CraftingService` to orchestrate the "craft item" use case. Defined custom exceptions for clear error handling and added a full suite of tests to validate its behavior.

33. **Prompt:** "Let's update the main composition root to include the new `CraftingService` and `CharacterRepository`."
    -   **Outcome:** Wired up the new `CraftingService` and `JsonFileCharacterRepository` in `main.py`. Updated the `Game` class instantiation to include the new dependencies, and updated tests to match.

34. **Prompt:** "Refactor the `Game` class to accept and use the new `CraftingService` and `character_id`."
    -   **Outcome:** Updated the `Game` class `__init__` method to accept and store the `CraftingService` and `character_id`. Refactored the corresponding tests in `test_game.py` to provide the new dependencies.

35. **Prompt:** "Let's create the `BuildView` UI component and its tests now."
    -   **Outcome:** Created the `BuildView` component, a "dumb" sprite that displays a list of schematics and uses a callback to handle user input. Added a full suite of tests to verify its rendering and event handling logic.

36. **Prompt:** "Now, let's integrate the `BuildView` into the `Game` class."
    -   **Outcome:** Integrated the `BuildView` into the main `Game` class. Added a query method to the `CraftingService` to fetch data for the view, and implemented event handlers in the `Game` class to toggle the view's visibility and connect its actions to the service.

37. **Prompt:** "Now that crafting is working, let's add an event handler that displays a message in a `MessageView` when an item is crafted."
    -   **Outcome:** Added a `MessageView` to the `Game` class and a `show_message` method to control it. In the composition root (`main.py`), subscribed a lambda function to the `ItemCrafted` event, which calls the `show_message` method, demonstrating a clean UI reaction to a domain event.

38. **Prompt:** "Cannot access attribute "assert_called_once_with" for class "MethodType"..."
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a `Pylance` type-checking error in `test_crafting_service.py` by changing mock creation from `spec=Character` to the more robust `autospec=Character`.

39. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_toggles_build_view..."
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed two test failures by improving mock configurations. Used `spec=BuildView` to create a more realistic sprite mock and corrected the order of mock setup in `test_main.py` to ensure dependencies were configured before the code under test was called.

40. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_toggles_build_view - assert 3 == 2"
    -   **Outcome:** Corrected an assertion in `test_game.py` that was not updated after a new default sprite was added to the `Game` class. Also improved mock quality by switching from `spec` to `autospec` for service mocks.

41. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_initialization - AssertionError: assert False"
    -   **Outcome:** Fixed a test fixture that was providing an invalid empty list to a UI component, causing an initialization error. The mock for `load_spritesheet` was updated to return a valid mock icon.

42. **Prompt:** "ERROR tests/presentation/test_game.py... TypeError: argument 1 must be pygame.surface.Surface, not Mock"
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a `TypeError` in the `test_game.py` suite by updating a mock in a shared fixture. The mock for `load_spritesheet` was changed to return a real `pygame.Surface` instead of a `Mock` object, satisfying the type requirements of un-mocked Pygame functions.

43. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_initialization - AssertionError: assert False"
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a cryptic test failure by refactoring the `Game` class to remove a redundant `pygame.init()` call. This improved the design by clarifying responsibilities and stabilized the test fixture environment.

44. **Prompt:** "FAILED tests/presentation/test_game.py::test_game_initialization - AssertionError: assert False (re-run)"
    -   **Outcome:** Resolved a recurring cryptic test failure by patching `pygame.transform.scale` in the shared `mocked_game_instance` fixture. This prevents a hidden exception during `Game` initialization in the test environment.
